# EcoSoundClips

## Synopsis

Name: EcoSoundClips

This is an Android app to play environmental sounds.

There are 8 categories of environmental sounds: Earthquake, Fire, Forest, Jungle, Ocean, Rain, Thunder and Wind.  

When one of the MainActivity gid view photographs in the categories above is selected, a list of related sounds displays in a list on another Activity.

Clicking on the play button, to the right of each sound list, plays a clip of the environmental sound using Media Player.

## Motivation

This is the fourth exercise in the "Grow with Google - Android Basic Development Nanodegree Scholarship 2018" program with Udacity.

The purpose of the exercise is to create "musical structure app." I opted for a app with environmental sounds instead of a albumn covers and songs.
